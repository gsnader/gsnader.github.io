	<h2> W i n e m a k e r </h2>

	
		<p>My name is Gregory Snader, and I love to make wine. I have a decade of experience, covering a wide range of fermentations, including beer, miso and mead. </p>

		<p>Some of my favorite style sof wine including South American Malbecs and North American Chardonnays. My journey in winemaking began with a study abroad trip to Italy. Participating in the 2005 Vindemia and helping local Italians harvest and produce their own wines from their own backyards helped to initiate my journey into winemaking.</p>

		<p>For the past 8 years I have worked as a winemaker and wine teacher. I regularly help new winemakers begin their own journeys. I hope my contact with them is just as memorable as my own experience with the vindemia. If you would like to learn the ancient art of winemaking, <a href= "mailto:gsnader@gmail.com">get in touch with me</a>, I'd love to talk to you!
		Cheers!</p>
